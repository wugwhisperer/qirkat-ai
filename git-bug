Ignoring my stylecheck errors, but main error is found by running the integration test Test script 04-win2.inp. My output is that Black wins, even though White should win. When I checked the moves the AIs made, they were all valid moves, but they did not actually consider all possible moves, and I think I may have ignored some valid moves. I believe my main problem occurs in the implementation of getJumps(ArrayList<moves>, k) and its helper function, getJumpsH.
